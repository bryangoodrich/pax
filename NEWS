  and patch)

* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)

* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

  `function` (output file will include the function) or a character string.

* `new_test` added to quickly produce a **testthat** style test .R template file 
   from a `function` (output file will include the function) or a character string.

  one call.
